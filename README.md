# Chronic-Disease
- Predicting the Prevalence Rate for Multiple Chronic Diseases Using Machine Learning
-  The main aim is to perform Machine learning algorithms to analyse the motor activities and patterns of depressed patients and their healthy controls.
- To analyze how rates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have changed throughout time.
-	To examine potential causes of and trends toward hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
-To use statistical methods to construct a model that can predict the future incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
-To predict how the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity would change as a result of shifting demographic and lifestyle factors.
-	To determine the possible financial and logistical effects of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity on healthcare systems.

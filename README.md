#  Predicting Chronic-Disease

- Predicting the Prevalence Rate for Multiple Chronic Diseases Using Machine Learning

- System Requirements
- Python 3.7 and above
- Pandas, Sci-kit learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

- Project Deliverables
- Dataset: A dataset that has already been cleaned and preprocessed and that contains relevant characteristics relating to the prevalence of chronic diseases, demography, 
          lifestyle factors, and socio-economic indicators is called a preprocessed dataset.
- Trained model of machine learning: A machine learning model built in Python and trained on the dataset, with the goal of predicting the prevalence rates of hypertension, 
                                    diabetes, and obesity.

- The main aim is to perform Machine learning algorithms to analyse the motor activities and patterns of depressed patients and their healthy controls.
- To analyze how rates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have changed throughout time.
- To use statistical methods to construct a model that can predict the future incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
- To predict how the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity would change as a result of shifting demographic and lifestyle factors.
- To determine the possible financial and logistical effects of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity
